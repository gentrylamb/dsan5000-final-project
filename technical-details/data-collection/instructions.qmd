# Data Collection

## Data Source Information

All data used in this project originates from *[Bike Washington](http://bikewashington.org/routes/all.htm)*. The website provides detailed information about bike routes within the DMV (DC, Maryland, and Virginia) area. Specifically, it includes:
- **Trail Length:** Measured in miles.
- **Trail Name:** The name of each bike route.
- **Trail Description:** A summary of the trailâ€™s features.
- **Ratings:** Scores for terrain difficulty, traffic levels, and scenic beauty.

### Rating Definitions
- **Terrain:** A score of `1` corresponds to a very flat trail, while `5` represents extremely challenging climbs.
- **Traffic:** A score of `1` indicates minimal traffic, while `5` suggests heavy traffic conditions.
- **Scenery:** A score of `1` indicates a highly scenic trail, whereas `5` represents less visually appealing routes.

## Data Collection Methods

We utilized Selenium, an open-source browser automation framework, to scrape data from the website. Specifically:
- The `webdriver` function was employed to extract trail names, mileage, and ratings.
- The extracted data was processed using Pandas to consolidate all relevant information into a single DataFrame.
- The tabular data was then saved for future analysis.
