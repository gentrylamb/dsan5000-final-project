# Introduction and Motivation 

## Goals

The primary objective of this project is to leverage data from [bikewashington.org](http://bikewashington.org) to provide actionable insights about bike paths in Washington, DC. By analyzing and presenting detailed information about these trails, we aim to help riders make informed decisions about their routes. This knowledge will enhance their preparation and contribute to safer biking experiences across the city.

## Motivation

Our motivation lies in supporting the biking community by empowering riders to choose trails that align with their specific needs and goals. Whether for exercise, commuting, or leisure, informed decisions about bike paths can optimize the overall experience. Additionally, providing better trail information is expected to inherently enhance safety, especially for those exploring new or unfamiliar routes.

## Objectives

- **Trail Clustering:** Group similar bike trails in Washington, DC, using algorithms such as KMeans Clustering and Spectral Clustering.
- **Length Prediction:** Develop a regression decision tree model to predict the length of a trail based on its other qualities.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Offer tailored trail recommendations for riders of varying experience levels, addressing their unique preferences.

## Data Source Information

All data used in this project originates from *[Bike Washington](http://bikewashington.org/routes/all.htm)*. The website provides a table of detailed information about bike routes within the DMV (DC, Maryland, and Virginia) area. Specifically, it includes:

- **Trail Length:** Measured in miles.
- **Trail Name:** The name of each bike route.
- **Trail Description:** A summary of the trailâ€™s features.
- **Ratings:** Scores for terrain difficulty, traffic levels, and scenic beauty.

### Rating Definitions

- **Terrain:** A score of `1` corresponds to a very flat trail, while `5` represents extremely challenging climbs.
- **Traffic:** A score of `1` indicates minimal traffic, while `5` suggests heavy traffic conditions.
- **Scenery:** A score of `1` indicates a highly scenic trail, whereas `5` represents less visually appealing routes.

## Data Structure and Format

The cleaned data was exported to a CSV file consisting of:

- **Rows:** 43 (one for each trail).
- **Columns:** 6 (trail name, description, mileage, terrain rating, traffic rating, and scenery rating).
- **Data Types:** 
  - `string` for trail names and descriptions.
  - `integer` for mileage and ratings.
- **Regression Target:** mileage
- **Binary Classification Target:** *insert here*
- **Multiclass-Classification Target:** location of trail (Maryland, Virginia, or DC) - found in the description


# Overview of Methods

We utilized [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/), an open-source framework for automating web browsers, to scrape data from bikewashington.org. Since the site relied heavily on JavaScript for loading, Selenium was used to render the desired elements. From there, elements were located using Xpaths so the it could then be extracted directly from the HTML structure. The scraped information included trail names, descriptions, lengths, and ratings, which were initially stored in lists and later consolidated into a single Pandas DataFrame.
