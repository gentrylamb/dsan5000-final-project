## Summary
Washington DC is a leader in urban cycling infrastructure, with an expansive network of bike lanes and trails supporting eco-friendly commuting. However, DC's trails are not only for commuting within the city but also numerous options for purely recreational use. In the confides of a large city these options for recreation can be extremly popular, so a deeper understanding of bike route utilization, accessibility, and safety are imperative. This project focuses on scraping, analyzing, and visualizing data about DC’s bike routes to identify patterns and trends through clustering and classification. The insights gained can guide city planners in optimizing infrastructure, improving safety, and promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation.

## Significance
Cycling is integral to sustainable urban mobility, offering benefits such as reduced carbon emissions, improved public health, and decreased traffic congestion. By analyzing cycling routes, we can uncover patterns of use, gaps in infrastructure, and safety concerns, enabling data-driven decision-making for a greener and safer DC.

## Research Questions
1. How can clustering techniques help categorize bike routes based on usage, distance, location, or ratings?
2. Which factors are the most important in clustering of bike routes?
3. Is it possible to classify bike routes with existing data?
4. What insights can be drawn about the existing routes in developing more routes as the city grows?
5. What data would make this clustering and classification more robust? 

### Literature review

Once you decide on a topic, you should `ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW`, this is particularly important for academic projects.

The literature review is the most important part of most projects. 

It allows you to; 

* 1. Determine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you `don't re-invent the wheel`.
* 2. It makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to `ask the right questions`, `target impactful projects`, and `communicate with other professionals`.

> Doing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980's, isn't a great use of time.

In this section, please do a literature review and cite at least **3 academic publications** per group member, and include **internal academic citations**.

**Optional**: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more

By following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.

1. **Expand Your Literature Search**  
   Aim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.

2. **Skim the Abstracts**  
   Read the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.

3. **Use LLM Tools for Summarization**  
   Upload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.

4. **Leverage Interactive LLM Tools**  
   Use tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:
   - Example questions:
     - "In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?"
     - "Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?"
   These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers.

*Article 1: "Machine Learning Approaches to Bike-Sharing Systems: A Systematic Literature Review"*
This article details numerous applications of machine learning techniques within the sphere of bike-sharing systems (BSS). It stresses the importance of these systems in the modern era, highlighting their role in reducing carbon emissions, improving transportation accessibility, and influencing the overall transportation culture of a city. The paper reviews 35 studies from 2015 to 2019, aiming to evaluate the performance of various machine learning techniques applied to BSS while also identifying challenges and proposing future research directions. The methodology used to evaluate the machine learning methods is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Framework. Key findings from the paper include the high accuracy with which random forests and gradient boosting machines predicted bike availability and demand trends. Other techniques, such as decision trees and deep learning, were useful for understanding trip patterns and user segmentation. Deep learning, in particular, is becoming more prevalent, as neural networks are capable of efficiently handling complex datasets. Finally, clustering techniques were applied to analyze station usage patterns and trends. The paper concludes that, through a combination of machine learning, transportation engineering, and planning, future efforts should focus on developing machine learning models that are easily interpretable and transferable to various cities. Another goal is to leverage real-time data to optimize BSS instantaneously (@albuquerque2021machine).

*Article 2: "Learning to Cluster Urban Areas: Two Competitive Approaches and an Empirical Validation"*
This article compares two clustering methodologies to effectively group urban areas with similar characteristics. The two approaches introduced are Deep Modularity Networks (DMON) and a traditional graph-based clustering method. DMON is a neural network approach designed to optimize cluster modularity. Specifically, it graphically represents urban areas and connects them to other areas that share similar spatial or economic traits. The network maximizes modularity while adapting to different situations for greater flexibility. The traditional graph method, on the other hand, relies on classical algorithms like spectral clustering. Although these algorithms also maximize modularity, they underperform in terms of adaptability, scalability, and other areas. Through empirical validation, the authors demonstrate that DMON outperforms the traditional graph method in terms of performance, processing efficiency, and utility. One application of DMON discussed in the paper is its use for transportation planning. This clustering method helps identify critical transportation nodes and corridors, facilitating more efficient transit design. However, DMON has some limitations, particularly in terms of interpretability. Deep learning often produces outputs that are difficult for non-experts to understand, which could hinder the urban planning process and lead to stagnation. Despite this, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering methods in addressing urban environmental issues (@vera2022learning).

*Article 3: "A Taxonomy of Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms, Challenges, and Future Realms"*
Unlike the previous two papers, this research offers a more comprehensive examination of clustering algorithms. The paper categorizes various clustering algorithms based on their methodologies and use cases, providing insight into which algorithms are best suited for specific situations. More specifically, the paper focuses on five different types of clustering algorithms: partitioning-based clustering, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, model-based clustering, and graph-based clustering. Partitioning-based clustering is best used in applications such as customer segmentation and urban planning. Hierarchical clustering is more appropriate for social network analysis or gene expression studies. Density-based clustering is suitable for spatial analysis and transportation planning. Model-based clustering is commonly applied to problems involving images and text. Finally, graph-based clustering excels in social network detection and geospatial analysis. Regardless of the problem, all clustering methods have their inherent limitations and should be used carefully. Future directions for clustering algorithms include combining two or more algorithms to leverage their strengths, as well as exploring automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance for specific problems. Clustering is an invaluable tool for solving real-world problems, but it is essential to choose the right algorithm based on the specific context (@pitafi2023taxonomy).
