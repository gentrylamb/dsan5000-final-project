### Create a Landing Page for Your Project  

- Summarize your topic, its significance, related work, and the questions you plan to explore.
- Draft an introduction with at least **5 research questions**. These may evolve as your project progresses, since data science is an iterative process.
- Include your data science questions on this page.




## Summary
Washington DC is a leader in urban cycling infrastructure, with an expansive network of bike lanes and trails supporting eco-friendly commuting. However, DC's trails are not only for commuting within the city but also numerous options for purely recreational use. In the confides of a large city these options for recreation can be extremly popular, so a deeper understanding of bike route utilization, accessibility, and safety are imperative. This project focuses on scraping, analyzing, and visualizing data about DC’s bike routes to identify patterns and trends through clustering and classification. The insights gained can guide city planners in optimizing infrastructure, improving safety, and promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation.

## Significance
Cycling is integral to sustainable urban mobility, offering benefits such as reduced carbon emissions, improved public health, and decreased traffic congestion. By analyzing cycling routes, we can uncover patterns of use, gaps in infrastructure, and safety concerns, enabling data-driven decision-making for a greener and safer DC.

## Related Work
- Urban Cycling Studies: Research linking bike infrastructure to cycling adoption and safety.
- Geospatial Data Science: Use of clustering algorithms for route categorization and optimization in other urban contexts.
- Machine Learning in Mobility: Classification techniques applied to transportation data to understand user behavior and needs.
- Local Reports: Existing reports on cycling trends in Washington, DC, such as those from DDOT and Capital Bikeshare.

## Research Questions
1. How can clustering techniques help categorize bike routes based on usage, distance, location, or ratings?
2. Which factors are the most important in clustering of bike routes?
3. Is it possible to classify bike routes with existing data?
4. What insights can be drawn about the existing routes in developing more routes as the city grows?
5. What data would make this clustering and classification more robust? 

### Literature review

Once you decide on a topic, you should `ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW`, this is particularly important for academic projects.

The literature review is the most important part of most projects. 

It allows you to; 

* 1. Determine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you `don't re-invent the wheel`.
* 2. It makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to `ask the right questions`, `target impactful projects`, and `communicate with other professionals`.

> Doing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980's, isn't a great use of time.

In this section, please do a literature review and cite at least **3 academic publications** per group member, and include **internal academic citations**.

**Optional**: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more

By following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.

1. **Expand Your Literature Search**  
   Aim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.

2. **Skim the Abstracts**  
   Read the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.

3. **Use LLM Tools for Summarization**  
   Upload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.

4. **Leverage Interactive LLM Tools**  
   Use tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:
   - Example questions:
     - "In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?"
     - "Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?"
   These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers.


## Additional Ideas for things to include 

- **Audience**: Who is this for? Data professionals, businesses, researchers, or curious readers.
- **Headline**: A captivating title introducing the data science theme (e.g., "Unlocking Insights Through Data Stories").
- **Introduction**: A brief, engaging overview of what the website offers (e.g., data-driven stories, insights, or case studies).
- **Questions You Are Addressing**: What do you hope to learn?
- **Motivation**: Explain why this topic matters, highlighting the importance of data in solving real-world problems.
- **Key Topics**: List the main focus areas (e.g., machine learning, data visualization, predictive modeling).
- **Use Cases/Examples**: A brief teaser of compelling stories or case studies you’ve worked on.
- **Call to Action**: Invite visitors to explore the content, follow along, or contact you for more information.
- **Visual/Infographic**: Add a simple graphic or visual element to make the page more dynamic.
