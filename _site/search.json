These individuals expect detailed explanations of models, algorithms, methodologies, or system architectures, and they’re comfortable with technical jargon, such as discussing hyperparameters, programming frameworks, or machine learning techniques.\nNon-technical audiences include executives, marketing teams, and clients. They prioritize high-level insights, actionable results, and visualizations that convey the impact of data without requiring an understanding of complex methods. For instance, a CEO may want to know how a model affects business strategy or revenue, without diving into the underlying technical details.\n\nIn this project you will cater to both audiences.

Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable."

You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important."

This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop.

You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\nPrototype and develop on a small data set\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

Example: “Addressing churn drivers can reduce loss and improve profitability.”\nAppendix (Optional): Additional charts or explanations for further insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplicity: Avoid jargon; focus on business-relevant insights.\nVisual Focus: Prioritize charts and graphs over dense text.\nEmphasize Impact: Always link data insights to business outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing to a new city can be overwhelming, especially when considering all of the new traditions, attractions, and outdoor activities that come with it. For avid biking fans, this stress is further amplified when trying to find new bike paths to explore. Which bike paths offer the best scenery around the city? Which paths are best for getting to work, going to the grocery store, or going somewhere else important? All of these are natural questions that come to mind when thinking about the biking scene of a new city. Even for those not passionate about biking, companies like Lime, Capital Bikeshare, and others provide accessible eBikes for those looking to get off their feet. Biking, both as a hobby and as a simple mode of transportation, is an essential part of a city’s culture. Not only that, it helps lower carbon emissions, aiding in the environmental footprint a city has. Undoubtedly, biking is an essential activity in the lives of many, especially those living in Washington, DC. It can be a daunting task to look at all bike trails in the area to find ones that best fit your goals. This study attempts to rectify that concern by clustering bike paths based on their inherent qualities. Specifically, we focus on three qualities to cluster the bike paths effectively - difficulty of terrain, the amount of traffic the bike path sees, and the scenery of the bike path. With these characteristics, we hope to group similar bike paths together, allowing the public to see which paths are best for their needs.\n\n\n\nOur objective is to group similar bike paths together based on three discrete variables - terrain, traffic, and scenery."

    "text": "We believe that the adoption of LLM tools is inevitable and will be an important skill for success in your future career. Therefore, appropriate and acceptable use of LLM tools is encouraged for this project. Use them to accelerate your workflow and learning, but not as a replacement for critical thinking and understanding. Carefully review and process their output, use them judiciously, and avoid bloating your text with LLM-generated content. Overusing these tools often degrades the quality of your work rather than enhancing it.\nRemember the following guidelines:\n\nUse common sense: If you feel like you’re doing something questionable, you probably are. A good test is to ask yourself, “Would I openly tell the professor or classmates what I’m doing right now?” If the answer is no, you’re probably doing something you shouldn’t.\nCite your LLM use cases: Always cite when and how you’ve used LLM tools. This is a requirement for the project.\nIs your use helping you grow professionally?: If your use of LLM tools is making you a more competent, efficient, and knowledgeable professional, you’re probably using them in an appropriate manner. If you’re using them as a shortcut to avoid work and gain free time, you’re using them incorrectly.\n\n\n\nALWAY CITE CONTENT OR IDEAS TAKEN FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES: e.g. websites, llm tools, papers\nALWAYS BE TRANSPARENT WHEN YOU ARE USING LLM TOOLS:\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n\nGeneral Tasks: Create and regularly update a dedicated LLM Transparency page to document how you are using LLM tools.\n\nThis page can serve as a “catch-all” for use cases that don’t involve content creation, such as reformatting your own ideas, commenting code that you wrote, or proofreading text, PDF summarization.\n\nContent Creation: If non-original content (code or text) is generated by an LLM, you must also cite it on specific pages, just like any external source.\n\nFor non-original content, always provide a citation.\nCite the LLM tool after each chunk of text or code it generates, using a BibTeX. For example1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Various useful non-LLM research tools can be found here at the following link\n\nTraditional research tools\n\nYou can use LLM tools for the following use cases\n\nAI research tools\nThese include\n\nre-formating text with LLM tools.\nCode explaination “describe what this code is doing in prose”\nText summarization\nProofreading\n\nchatGPT for project brainstorming\nUsing LLM tools to comment your code qualifies as an acceptible use case in this project. You can also use or code re-formatters such as black to increase the readability of your code.\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT use ChatGPT or other LLM tools to write large portions of your text or code.\n\n\nIf it is clear that you have used LLM tools to write large portions of your code or text, your grade will reflect this, likely in the range of 0% to 50% of the total points, depending on the quality of the work. LLM outputs still require significant polishing to fit into a well-written, cohesive narrative. If it is evident that you simply inserted large portions of LLM-generated content into your assignment without taking the time to refine it into a high-quality submission, your grade will reflect this, even if the usage does not rise to the level of plagiarism.\n\n\n\nIn extreme cases,the following actions will occur.\n\nOne-on-One Investigation: You will meet with department faculty for a thorough review of your project. You will be asked to explain your work in detail, including what specific chunks of code do, why you made certain decisions, and how you reached your conclusions.\nReferral to the Honor Council: If, during this meeting, it is determined that you do not have sufficient understanding of the content that you claimed to have created, the case will be documented and sent to the honor council. This can result in a permanent mark on your transcript and may even lead to expulsion from the university."

    "text": "Remember, slow and steady wins the race\nMaking steady, incremental progress on a large project generally makes it more manageable. Rushing to throw something together under a tight deadline often turns the process into a nightmare.\n\n\n\nThis is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable.\n\n\n\n“Data science” is essentially a collection of useful computational and mathematical skills (statistics, cloud computing, machine learning, coding, etc). However, to maximize your effectiveness, these skills should be applied to a domain of interest (e.g., materials science, finance, healthcare, etc). Focusing and learning about a particular domain will help you specialize and make you more marketable.\nThat beind said, don’t worry about choosing the “perfect” domain—it’s always possible to pivot later, as many of the skills learned, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-education, are transferable across all fields.\n\n\n\nImpact in science refers to the significance and influence of research, often measured by metrics like citations, impact factor of journals, and indices like h-index. These metrics reflect how widely recognized and valuable the work is within the scientific community. Such quanities are used to compare researchers and journals, and are used to determine grant funding and career opportunities.\n\nImpact Factor (IF):\n\nA measure of a journal’s influence, calculated by averaging the number of citations to articles published in the journal over the past two years.\nHigher impact factors indicate a more influential journal.\n\nNumber of Citations:\n\nThe total count of how often a researcher’s work is cited by others, reflecting its influence within the scientific community.\nMore citations generally signal broader recognition or relevance of the research.\n\nh-index:\n\nA metric that measures both productivity and citation impact. An h-index of 10 means a researcher has 10 papers each cited at least 10 times.\nHigher h-index indicates more influential and widely recognized work.\n\ni10-index:\n\nCounts the number of a researcher’s publications with at least 10 citations.\nA straightforward measure of citation impact, commonly used by Google Scholar.\n\nImportance of Citations:\n\nCitations indicate that other researchers find the work valuable for their own research, increasing its perceived credibility and impact in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional academic or industrial research is all about discovery, improvement, and novelty. You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important.\n\n\n\n80-20 Rule: This rule of thumb suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of causes. In other words, a small number of key factors drive the majority of outcomes. This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop. Strive to take this project as far as possible, but remember to stop and “call it done” at some point.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations are a critical component of your portfolio. Use them strategically to support your narrative. The more visual representations of your data, the better—higher-quality visualizations will result in a higher grade. Ensure that all graphics follow best practices:\n\nChoose the right chart type: Match the chart to the data (e.g., bar for categories, line for trends).\nMaintain simplicity: Avoid clutter and focus on the essential message.\nUse appropriate scales: Ensure axes have correct and intuitive scaling to avoid misinterpretation.\nLabel axes clearly: Include meaningful axis labels with units (e.g., “Temperature (°C)” or “Revenue (USD)”).\nInclude descriptive titles: Provide a concise, informative title that explains the visualization’s main takeaway.\nEnsure consistency: Use uniform color schemes, fonts, and styles across all charts in a presentation.\nHighlight key data: Use contrasting colors or annotations to draw attention to important points or trends.\nKeep proportions accurate: Maintain correct data-to-visual size relationships to avoid distortion.\nConsider the audience: Tailor the level of detail and style to the audience’s technical proficiency.\nTest readability: Ensure fonts, colors, and elements are clear and legible in various formats and sizes.\nUse interactivity carefully: Interactive features should add clarity, not complexity, to the visual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not required, practice is highly beneficial. It’s also a good habit to write your code from scratch, as this will build your problem-solving skills. You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\n\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project .\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember the following Debugging Steps:\n\nStep A: Copy the error message and search it online (Google or similar).\nStep B: Look through forums or documentation to find a solution.\nStep C: Implement the solution.\nStep D: If you’re still stuck, ask for help from classmates, TAs, or professors.\nStep E: Move on to the next issue and repeat the process.\n\n\n(Note: You can also use ChatGPT for debugging, but be cautious as the solutions may sometimes be inaccurate or incomplete.)"

Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\nIn the past decade, urban cycling infrastructure has garnered attention due to the relevance in addressing environmental sustainability concerns. Cycling offers a low-cost, sustainable mode of transportation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, mitigates traffic congestion, and promotes physical activity. Understanding the current landscape of research on this topic is crucial for identifying gaps in knowledge and expand on them. This literature review aims to harmonize key findings, methodologies, and trends have shaped the current understanding of this topic area.\n“How to Use Selenium to Web-Scrape with Example” provides a step-by-step guide on using Selenium, a Python library, for web scraping tasks, focusing on extracting NBA player salary data from Hoopshype. Selenium automates web browsers, allowing for efficient data collection from websites that may be otherwise difficult to scrape through traditional methods. Selenium’s advantage lies in its ability to interact with dynamic web pages, which may load content via JavaScript. This method is particularly useful for collecting structured data from websites that do not provide APIs or straightforward access to information, such as the site we are interested in gathering our data from. This article is relevant to our study as it demonstrates the basic workflow for setting up and using Selenium for web scraping. The same techniques of web driver installation, XPath usage, and data extraction will be applicable for scraping bike route information from the provided websites. Additionally, the iterative process of scraping multiple pages and aggregating data aligns with the need to collect comprehensive datasets for clustering and classification in this project.1\nIn the article “Visual Exploration of Cycling Semantics with GPS Trajectory Data”, the authors address the need for a comprehensive system to analyze cycling semantics from both the cyclist’s and the road’s perspectives. By utilizing large-scale GPS trajectory and road network data, the authors propose VizCycSemantics, a visual analytic system that aims to uncover hidden patterns in cycling behaviors and moving characteristics along road segments. While this paper gets bogged down with technical jargon about GPS data and challenges, they present some very interesting points on clustering. The VizCycSemantics system uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract cycling topics—representing cyclist behaviors—and k-means++ clustering to identify groups of similar cyclists and road segments. This research is particularly relevant to our project, as it provides a proven framework for analyzing cycling data through clustering and topic modeling. While our base approach will differ significantly, our goal of uncovering patterns in cycling routes and behaviors aligns well with their study.2\nChapter 9 of “Capital Dilemma” addresses bicycling trends and policies in the DC area since 1990. The study of cycling trends in the Washington, DC metropolitan area provides essential insights into the growing role of cycling in urban mobility and infrastructure planning. The expansion of bike lanes, along with innovative programs and policies, has significantly increased cycling levels in the region, particularly within the urban core of Washington, DC, Arlington, and Alexandria. As highlighted, cycling levels have risen in tandem with the development of bike-friendly infrastructure, such as on-street bike lanes and off-street shared-use paths, though challenges remain in terms of accessibility and inclusivity. This literature is highly relevant to our project, where we aim to analyze and classify bike routes in Washington, DC. Understanding the spatial distribution of bike lanes and their relationship with cyclist behavior in various neighborhoods offers a valuable framework for our clustering and classification efforts.3\nThe article “Machine Learning Approaches to Bike-Sharing Systems: A Systematic Literature Review” details numerous applications of machine learning techniques within the sphere of bike-sharing systems (BSS). It stresses the importance of these systems in the modern era, highlighting their role in reducing carbon emissions, improving transportation accessibility, and influencing the overall transportation culture of a city. The paper reviews 35 studies from 2015 to 2019, aiming to evaluate the performance of various machine learning techniques applied to BSS while also identifying challenges and proposing future research directions. The methodology used to evaluate the machine learning methods is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Framework. Key findings from the paper include the high accuracy with which random forests and gradient boosting machines predicted bike availability and demand trends. Other techniques, such as decision trees and deep learning, were useful for understanding trip patterns and user segmentation. Deep learning, in particular, is becoming more prevalent, as neural networks are capable of efficiently handling complex datasets. Finally, clustering techniques were applied to analyze station usage patterns and trends. The paper concludes that, through a combination of machine learning, transportation engineering, and planning, future efforts should focus on developing machine learning models that are easily interpretable and transferable to various cities. Another goal is to leverage real-time data to optimize BSS instantaneously.4\nThe article “Learning to Cluster Urban Areas: Two Competitive Approaches and an Empirical Validation” compares two clustering methodologies to effectively group urban areas with similar characteristics. The two approaches introduced are Deep Modularity Networks (DMON) and a traditional graph-based clustering method. DMON is a neural network approach designed to optimize cluster modularity. Specifically, it graphically represents urban areas and connects them to other areas that share similar spatial or economic traits. The network maximizes modularity while adapting to different situations for greater flexibility. The traditional graph method, on the other hand, relies on classical algorithms like spectral clustering. Although these algorithms also maximize modularity, they underperform in terms of adaptability, scalability, and other areas. Through empirical validation, the authors demonstrate that DMON outperforms the traditional graph method in terms of performance, processing efficiency, and utility. One application of DMON discussed in the paper is its use for transportation planning. This clustering method helps identify critical transportation nodes and corridors, facilitating more efficient transit design. However, DMON has some limitations, particularly in terms of interpretability. Deep learning often produces outputs that are difficult for non-experts to understand, which could hinder the urban planning process and lead to stagnation. Despite this, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering methods in addressing urban environmental issues.5\nUnlike the previous two papers, this research, “A Taxonomy of Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms, Challenges, and Future Realms”, offers a more comprehensive examination of clustering algorithms. The paper categorizes various clustering algorithms based on their methodologies and use cases, providing insight into which algorithms are best suited for specific situations. More specifically, the paper focuses on five different types of clustering algorithms: partitioning-based clustering, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, model-based clustering, and graph-based clustering. Partitioning-based clustering is best used in applications such as customer segmentation and urban planning. Hierarchical clustering is more appropriate for social network analysis or gene expression studies. Density-based clustering is suitable for spatial analysis and transportation planning. Model-based clustering is commonly applied to problems involving images and text. Finally, graph-based clustering excels in social network detection and geospatial analysis. Regardless of the problem, all clustering methods have their inherent limitations and should be used carefully. Future directions for clustering algorithms include combining two or more algorithms to leverage their strengths, as well as exploring automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance for specific problems. Clustering is an invaluable tool for solving real-world problems, but it is essential to choose the right algorithm based on the specific context.6"
