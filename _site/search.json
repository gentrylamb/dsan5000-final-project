These individuals expect detailed explanations of models, algorithms, methodologies, or system architectures, and they’re comfortable with technical jargon, such as discussing hyperparameters, programming frameworks, or machine learning techniques.\nNon-technical audiences include executives, marketing teams, and clients. They prioritize high-level insights, actionable results, and visualizations that convey the impact of data without requiring an understanding of complex methods. For instance, a CEO may want to know how a model affects business strategy or revenue, without diving into the underlying technical details.\n\nIn this project you will cater to both audiences.

Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable."

You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important."

No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop.

You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\nPrototype and develop on a small data set\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

    "text": "Summary\nWashington DC is a leader in urban cycling infrastructure, with an expansive network of bike lanes and trails supporting eco-friendly commuting. However, DC’s trails are not only for commuting within the city but also numerous options for purely recreational use. In the confides of a large city these options for recreation can be extremly popular, so a deeper understanding of bike route utilization, accessibility, and safety are imperative. This project focuses on scraping, analyzing, and visualizing data about DC’s bike routes to identify patterns and trends through clustering and classification. The insights gained can guide city planners in optimizing infrastructure, improving safety, and promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation."

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\nIn the past decade, urban cycling infrastructure has garnered attention due to the relevance in addressing environmental sustainability concerns. Cycling offers a low-cost, sustainable mode of transportation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, mitigates traffic congestion, and promotes physical activity. Understanding the current landscape of research on this topic is crucial for identifying gaps in knowledge and expand on them. This literature review aims to harmonize key findings, methodologies, and trends have shaped the current understanding of this topic area.\n“How to Use Selenium to Web-Scrape with Example”1 provides a step-by-step guide on using Selenium, a Python library, for web scraping tasks, focusing on extracting NBA player salary data from Hoopshype. Selenium automates web browsers, allowing for efficient data collection from websites that may be otherwise difficult to scrape through traditional methods. Selenium’s advantage lies in its ability to interact with dynamic web pages, which may load content via JavaScript. This method is particularly useful for collecting structured data from websites that do not provide APIs or straightforward access to information, such as the site we are interested in gathering our data from. This article is relevant to our study as it demonstrates the basic workflow for setting up and using Selenium for web scraping. The same techniques of web driver installation, XPath usage, and data extraction will be applicable for scraping bike route information from the provided websites. Additionally, the iterative process of scraping multiple pages and aggregating data aligns with the need to collect comprehensive datasets for clustering and classification in this project.\nIn the article “Visual Exploration of Cycling Semantics with GPS Trajectory Data”2, the authors address the need for a comprehensive system to analyze cycling semantics from both the cyclist’s and the road’s perspectives. By utilizing large-scale GPS trajectory and road network data, the authors propose VizCycSemantics, a visual analytic system that aims to uncover hidden patterns in cycling behaviors and moving characteristics along road segments. While this paper gets bogged down with technical jargon about GPS data and challenges, they present some very interesting points on clustering. The VizCycSemantics system uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract cycling topics—representing cyclist behaviors—and k-means++ clustering to identify groups of similar cyclists and road segments. This research is particularly relevant to our project, as it provides a proven framework for analyzing cycling data through clustering and topic modeling. While our base approach will differ significantly, our goal of uncovering patterns in cycling routes and behaviors aligns well with their study.\nChapter 9 of “Capital Dilemma”3 addresses bicycling trends and policies in the DC area since 1990. The study of cycling trends in the Washington, DC metropolitan area provides essential insights into the growing role of cycling in urban mobility and infrastructure planning. The expansion of bike lanes, along with innovative programs and policies, has significantly increased cycling levels in the region, particularly within the urban core of Washington, DC, Arlington, and Alexandria. As highlighted, cycling levels have risen in tandem with the development of bike-friendly infrastructure, such as on-street bike lanes and off-street shared-use paths, though challenges remain in terms of accessibility and inclusivity. This literature is highly relevant to our project, where we aim to analyze and classify bike routes in Washington, DC. Understanding the spatial distribution of bike lanes and their relationship with cyclist behavior in various neighborhoods offers a valuable framework for our clustering and classification efforts.\nThe article “Machine Learning Approaches to Bike-Sharing Systems: A Systematic Literature Review”4 details numerous applications of machine learning techniques within the sphere of bike-sharing systems (BSS). It stresses the importance of these systems in the modern era, highlighting their role in reducing carbon emissions, improving transportation accessibility, and influencing the overall transportation culture of a city. The paper reviews 35 studies from 2015 to 2019, aiming to evaluate the performance of various machine learning techniques applied to BSS while also identifying challenges and proposing future research directions. The methodology used to evaluate the machine learning methods is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Framework. Key findings from the paper include the high accuracy with which random forests and gradient boosting machines predicted bike availability and demand trends. Other techniques, such as decision trees and deep learning, were useful for understanding trip patterns and user segmentation. Deep learning, in particular, is becoming more prevalent, as neural networks are capable of efficiently handling complex datasets. Finally, clustering techniques were applied to analyze station usage patterns and trends. The paper concludes that, through a combination of machine learning, transportation engineering, and planning, future efforts should focus on developing machine learning models that are easily interpretable and transferable to various cities. Another goal is to leverage real-time data to optimize BSS instantaneously.\nThe article “Learning to Cluster Urban Areas: Two Competitive Approaches and an Empirical Validation”5 compares two clustering methodologies to effectively group urban areas with similar characteristics. The two approaches introduced are Deep Modularity Networks (DMON) and a traditional graph-based clustering method. DMON is a neural network approach designed to optimize cluster modularity. Specifically, it graphically represents urban areas and connects them to other areas that share similar spatial or economic traits. The network maximizes modularity while adapting to different situations for greater flexibility. The traditional graph method, on the other hand, relies on classical algorithms like spectral clustering. Although these algorithms also maximize modularity, they underperform in terms of adaptability, scalability, and other areas. Through empirical validation, the authors demonstrate that DMON outperforms the traditional graph method in terms of performance, processing efficiency, and utility. One application of DMON discussed in the paper is its use for transportation planning. This clustering method helps identify critical transportation nodes and corridors, facilitating more efficient transit design. However, DMON has some limitations, particularly in terms of interpretability. Deep learning often produces outputs that are difficult for non-experts to understand, which could hinder the urban planning process and lead to stagnation. Despite this, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering methods in addressing urban environmental issues.\nUnlike the previous two papers, this research, “A Taxonomy of Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms, Challenges, and Future Realms”6, offers a more comprehensive examination of clustering algorithms. The paper categorizes various clustering algorithms based on their methodologies and use cases, providing insight into which algorithms are best suited for specific situations. More specifically, the paper focuses on five different types of clustering algorithms: partitioning-based clustering, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, model-based clustering, and graph-based clustering. Partitioning-based clustering is best used in applications such as customer segmentation and urban planning. Hierarchical clustering is more appropriate for social network analysis or gene expression studies. Density-based clustering is suitable for spatial analysis and transportation planning. Model-based clustering is commonly applied to problems involving images and text. Finally, graph-based clustering excels in social network detection and geospatial analysis. Regardless of the problem, all clustering methods have their inherent limitations and should be used carefully. Future directions for clustering algorithms include combining two or more algorithms to leverage their strengths, as well as exploring automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance for specific problems. Clustering is an invaluable tool for solving real-world problems, but it is essential to choose the right algorithm based on the specific context."

    "text": "In this analysis, we explore the performance of regression and classification decision tree models to understand the intricate relationships within our dataset. We found that the regression tree outperformed the linear regression model, likely because decision trees do not assume any specific functional form or distribution, whereas linear regression attempts to fit a straight line through the data, which may not be suitable for complex relationships. Decision trees, by learning simple decision rules from features, are better equipped to capture the underlying patterns in the bike path dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe applied z-score normalization to the mileage feature to scale it appropriately with other features.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the limited size of the dataset, all available features were kept, with no extraction performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical features were one-hot encoded to convert them into a binary format suitable for modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used the train_test_split function from sklearn to divide the dataset into training and testing sets, applying a standard 80/20 split.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was divided such that 80% was used for training, and 20% was reserved for testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision tree models were selected due to their flexibility in capturing complex, non-linear relationships. We chose regression trees for continuous targets and classification trees for categorical targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression: A parametric model used as a baseline for regression tasks.\nRegression Tree: A non-parametric model that uses decision rules to predict continuous outcomes.\nBinary Classification Tree: A model for predicting binary outcomes, such as whether a bike path is a loop or not.\nMulticlass Classification Tree: A model used to predict more than two classes, applied to the ‘state1’ variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe began with linear regression as a baseline to understand how well a simple linear model could fit the data. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the target (‘sentiment’) and the input features. We evaluated the model using two metrics:\n\nRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the error between predicted and actual values, with a lower value being desirable.\nR²: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model, where higher values indicate better fits.\n\nFor this analysis, we obtained: - RMSE: 0.14 - R²: 0.03\nAlthough the RMSE is low, the R² value indicates a poor fit, suggesting that a linear model is insufficient for capturing the underlying relationships in the data. We decided to proceed with more complex models.\n\n\n\nNext, we applied a regression tree, which is non-parametric and can dynamically fit the data by learning decision rules. We fine-tuned the model by testing various max_depth hyperparameters, which control the depth of the tree. We found that a max_depth of 2 minimized the testing error while avoiding overfitting.\n\nOptimal hyperparameter: max_depth = 2\nTraining RMSE: 0.11\nTesting RMSE: 0.048 (lower than the linear regression model)\n\nThe regression tree significantly outperformed linear regression in terms of RMSE, indicating that the model was better suited to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\n\n\nAfter the regression task, we focused on a binary classification problem: predicting whether a bike path is a loop (1) or not (0). Given the poor R² from the linear regression, we chose to avoid logistic regression and instead used a decision tree for classification. We tuned the max_depth hyperparameter and found that a value of 7 yielded the best performance.\n\nOptimal hyperparameter: max_depth = 7\nAccuracy: 78%\nConfusion Matrix:\n\nNegative recall: 100%\nNegative precision: 75%\nPositive recall: 33%\nPositive precision: 100%\n\n\nThe model performed well in terms of accuracy, but the confusion matrix revealed that it frequently predicted the non-loop class (0), likely due to class imbalance in the dataset. This bias resulted in a low positive recall.\n\n\n\nFinally, we aimed to predict the ‘state1’ variable, which represents multiple categories. We evaluated the model by testing various max_depth values to find the optimal setting. We selected max_depth = 2 based on its performance.\n\nOptimal hyperparameter: max_depth = 2\nTest Accuracy: 44%\n\nAlthough the model outperformed random guessing, with an accuracy of 44%, it was not highly predictive. The confusion matrix indicated that the model tended to predict the most prevalent class correctly, but struggled with the other categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression tree emerged as the best-performing model, with a testing RMSE of 0.048, which indicates a good fit. However, further testing with additional data would be important for validating its robustness.\nThe binary classification tree performed well overall, with 78% accuracy, but the confusion matrix highlighted issues with class imbalance. The model heavily favored predicting non-loop paths, which reduced its utility in predicting the loop class.\nThe multiclass classification model achieved an accuracy of 44%, which is marginally better than guessing randomly. It often predicted the most common class, but failed to predict the other categories accurately. More data and improved feature engineering would likely enhance the performance of this model.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong all models tested, the regression tree offered the best performance with the lowest RMSE. The binary classification tree showed promising accuracy but suffered from class imbalance issues. The multiclass model’s performance was the weakest, highlighting the need for better predictive features or more data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression tree is the most reliable model for this dataset, as it can better capture non-linear relationships. For classification tasks, particularly binary classification, addressing class imbalance and tuning the model further is crucial. The multiclass model, while slightly better than random, would benefit from more data and better feature selection to improve predictive accuracy."

Below is a summary of the transformations applied to produce the cleaned dataset.\n\n\n\n\nUnpaved: Binary variable (1 = unpaved road, 0 = paved road).\nFlat: Binary variable (1 = flat road, 0 = not flat).\nWorkout: Binary variable (1 = trail designed for workouts, 0 = not designed for workouts).\nPark: Binary variable (1 = trail located in a park, 0 = not located in a park).\nRiver: Binary variable (1 = trail runs along a river, 0 = does not run along a river).\nLoop: Binary variable (1 = trail forms a loop, 0 = does not form a loop).\nSentiment: Float variable measuring the sentiment score of the trail description.\nState1: The state where the trail begins.\nState2: The state where the trail ends.\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset initially had no missing values—every cell contained data. To confirm, we used the is.na().sum() function in Python to verify the absence of null or missing values. When text-scraping trail descriptions to generate binary variables (e.g., identifying if the word “workout” was present), missing words were assumed to indicate the absence of that characteristic, and the corresponding cell was assigned a value of 0.\n\n\n\nOutliers were not a significant concern. For instance, while the C&O Towpath trail spans 184 miles—considerably longer than most other trails—removing such outliers was unnecessary. Given the limited number of bike trails in the DMV area, retaining all observations was crucial for maintaining data integrity and size.\n\n\n\nThe raw dataset contained two data types: object (trail names and descriptions) and int64 (ratings and mileage). After cleaning, the dataset included object, int64, and float64 types:\n\nObject: name, state1, state2.\nFloat64: sentiment.\nInt64: All other features.\n\nDescriptions were transformed to lowercase for consistency and ease of keyword matching. The most significant transformation involved converting descriptions into multiple binary (one-hot-encoded) features based on meaningful keywords, as described in the “New Variables” section. State information was also extracted using lists of specific locations within Virginia, Maryland, DC, and Pennsylvania, allowing us to assign values to state1 and state2. This process enabled the extraction of numerical data from text, enriching the dataset for subsequent machine learning analyses.\n\n\n\nGiven the significant right skew in the mileage distribution, normalization was applied. We used z-score normalization to scale this variable, ensuring it would not disproportionately influence machine learning models. Both normalized and unnormalized mileage distributions are provided in the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\nSubsetting is unnecessary due to the already small size of the dataset."

    "text": "We believe that the adoption of LLM tools is inevitable and will be an important skill for success in your future career. Therefore, appropriate and acceptable use of LLM tools is encouraged for this project. Use them to accelerate your workflow and learning, but not as a replacement for critical thinking and understanding. Carefully review and process their output, use them judiciously, and avoid bloating your text with LLM-generated content. Overusing these tools often degrades the quality of your work rather than enhancing it.\nRemember the following guidelines:\n\nUse common sense: If you feel like you’re doing something questionable, you probably are. A good test is to ask yourself, “Would I openly tell the professor or classmates what I’m doing right now?” If the answer is no, you’re probably doing something you shouldn’t.\nCite your LLM use cases: Always cite when and how you’ve used LLM tools. This is a requirement for the project.\nIs your use helping you grow professionally?: If your use of LLM tools is making you a more competent, efficient, and knowledgeable professional, you’re probably using them in an appropriate manner. If you’re using them as a shortcut to avoid work and gain free time, you’re using them incorrectly.\n\n\n\nALWAY CITE CONTENT OR IDEAS TAKEN FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES: e.g. websites, llm tools, papers\nALWAYS BE TRANSPARENT WHEN YOU ARE USING LLM TOOLS:\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n\nGeneral Tasks: Create and regularly update a dedicated LLM Transparency page to document how you are using LLM tools.\n\nThis page can serve as a “catch-all” for use cases that don’t involve content creation, such as reformatting your own ideas, commenting code that you wrote, or proofreading text, PDF summarization.\n\nContent Creation: If non-original content (code or text) is generated by an LLM, you must also cite it on specific pages, just like any external source.\n\nFor non-original content, always provide a citation.\nCite the LLM tool after each chunk of text or code it generates, using a BibTeX.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Various useful non-LLM research tools can be found here at the following link\n\nTraditional research tools\n\nYou can use LLM tools for the following use cases\n\nAI research tools\nThese include\n\nre-formating text with LLM tools.\nCode explaination “describe what this code is doing in prose”\nText summarization\nProofreading\n\nchatGPT for project brainstorming\nUsing LLM tools to comment your code qualifies as an acceptible use case in this project. You can also use or code re-formatters such as black to increase the readability of your code.\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT use ChatGPT or other LLM tools to write large portions of your text or code.\n\n\nIf it is clear that you have used LLM tools to write large portions of your code or text, your grade will reflect this, likely in the range of 0% to 50% of the total points, depending on the quality of the work. LLM outputs still require significant polishing to fit into a well-written, cohesive narrative. If it is evident that you simply inserted large portions of LLM-generated content into your assignment without taking the time to refine it into a high-quality submission, your grade will reflect this, even if the usage does not rise to the level of plagiarism.\n\n\n\nIn extreme cases,the following actions will occur.\n\nOne-on-One Investigation: You will meet with department faculty for a thorough review of your project. You will be asked to explain your work in detail, including what specific chunks of code do, why you made certain decisions, and how you reached your conclusions.\nReferral to the Honor Council: If, during this meeting, it is determined that you do not have sufficient understanding of the content that you claimed to have created, the case will be documented and sent to the honor council.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Remember, slow and steady wins the race\nMaking steady, incremental progress on a large project generally makes it more manageable. Rushing to throw something together under a tight deadline often turns the process into a nightmare.\n\n\n\nThis is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable.\n\n\n\n“Data science” is essentially a collection of useful computational and mathematical skills (statistics, cloud computing, machine learning, coding, etc). However, to maximize your effectiveness, these skills should be applied to a domain of interest (e.g., materials science, finance, healthcare, etc). Focusing and learning about a particular domain will help you specialize and make you more marketable.\nThat beind said, don’t worry about choosing the “perfect” domain—it’s always possible to pivot later, as many of the skills learned, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-education, are transferable across all fields.\n\n\n\nImpact in science refers to the significance and influence of research, often measured by metrics like citations, impact factor of journals, and indices like h-index. These metrics reflect how widely recognized and valuable the work is within the scientific community. Such quanities are used to compare researchers and journals, and are used to determine grant funding and career opportunities.\n\nImpact Factor (IF):\n\nA measure of a journal’s influence, calculated by averaging the number of citations to articles published in the journal over the past two years.\nHigher impact factors indicate a more influential journal.\n\nNumber of Citations:\n\nThe total count of how often a researcher’s work is cited by others, reflecting its influence within the scientific community.\nMore citations generally signal broader recognition or relevance of the research.\n\nh-index:\n\nA metric that measures both productivity and citation impact. An h-index of 10 means a researcher has 10 papers each cited at least 10 times.\nHigher h-index indicates more influential and widely recognized work.\n\ni10-index:\n\nCounts the number of a researcher’s publications with at least 10 citations.\nA straightforward measure of citation impact, commonly used by Google Scholar.\n\nImportance of Citations:\n\nCitations indicate that other researchers find the work valuable for their own research, increasing its perceived credibility and impact in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional academic or industrial research is all about discovery, improvement, and novelty. You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important.\n\n\n\n80-20 Rule: This rule of thumb suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of causes. In other words, a small number of key factors drive the majority of outcomes. This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop. Strive to take this project as far as possible, but remember to stop and “call it done” at some point.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations are a critical component of your portfolio. Use them strategically to support your narrative. The more visual representations of your data, the better—higher-quality visualizations will result in a higher grade. Ensure that all graphics follow best practices:\n\nChoose the right chart type: Match the chart to the data (e.g., bar for categories, line for trends).\nMaintain simplicity: Avoid clutter and focus on the essential message.\nUse appropriate scales: Ensure axes have correct and intuitive scaling to avoid misinterpretation.\nLabel axes clearly: Include meaningful axis labels with units (e.g., “Temperature (°C)” or “Revenue (USD)”).\nInclude descriptive titles: Provide a concise, informative title that explains the visualization’s main takeaway.\nEnsure consistency: Use uniform color schemes, fonts, and styles across all charts in a presentation.\nHighlight key data: Use contrasting colors or annotations to draw attention to important points or trends.\nKeep proportions accurate: Maintain correct data-to-visual size relationships to avoid distortion.\nConsider the audience: Tailor the level of detail and style to the audience’s technical proficiency.\nTest readability: Ensure fonts, colors, and elements are clear and legible in various formats and sizes.\nUse interactivity carefully: Interactive features should add clarity, not complexity, to the visual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not required, practice is highly beneficial. It’s also a good habit to write your code from scratch, as this will build your problem-solving skills. You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\n\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project .\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember the following Debugging Steps:\n\nStep A: Copy the error message and search it online (Google or similar).\nStep B: Look through forums or documentation to find a solution.\nStep C: Implement the solution.\nStep D: If you’re still stuck, ask for help from classmates, TAs, or professors.\nStep E: Move on to the next issue and repeat the process.\n\n\n(Note: You can also use ChatGPT for debugging, but be cautious as the solutions may sometimes be inaccurate or incomplete.)"

    "text": "This is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable."

You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important."

No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop.

You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\n\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

    "text": "In this analysis, we explore the performance of regression and classification decision tree models to understand the intricate relationships within our dataset. We found that the regression tree outperformed the linear regression model, likely because decision trees do not assume any specific functional form or distribution, whereas linear regression attempts to fit a straight line through the data, which may not be suitable for complex relationships. Decision trees, by learning simple decision rules from features, are better equipped to capture the underlying patterns in the bike path dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe applied z-score normalization to the mileage feature to scale it appropriately with other features.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the limited size of the dataset, all available features were kept, with no extraction performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical features were one-hot encoded to convert them into a binary format suitable for modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used the train_test_split function from sklearn to divide the dataset into training and testing sets, applying a standard 80/20 split.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was divided such that 80% was used for training, and 20% was reserved for testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision tree models were selected due to their flexibility in capturing complex, non-linear relationships. We chose regression trees for continuous targets and classification trees for categorical targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression: A parametric model used as a baseline for regression tasks.\nRegression Tree: A non-parametric model that uses decision rules to predict continuous outcomes.\nBinary Classification Tree: A model for predicting binary outcomes, such as whether a bike path is a loop or not.\nMulticlass Classification Tree: A model used to predict more than two classes, applied to the ‘state1’ variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe began with linear regression as a baseline to understand how well a simple linear model could fit the data. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the target (‘sentiment’) and the input features. We evaluated the model using two metrics:\n\nRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the error between predicted and actual values, with a lower value being desirable.\nR²: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model, where higher values indicate better fits.\n\nFor this analysis, we obtained: - RMSE: 0.14 - R²: 0.03\nAlthough the RMSE is low, the R² value indicates a poor fit, suggesting that a linear model is insufficient for capturing the underlying relationships in the data. We decided to proceed with more complex models.\n\n\n\nNext, we applied a regression tree, which is non-parametric and can dynamically fit the data by learning decision rules. We fine-tuned the model by testing various max_depth hyperparameters, which control the depth of the tree. We found that a max_depth of 2 minimized the testing error while avoiding overfitting.\n\nOptimal hyperparameter: max_depth = 2\nTraining RMSE: 0.11\nTesting RMSE: 0.048 (lower than the linear regression model)\n\nThe regression tree significantly outperformed linear regression in terms of RMSE, indicating that the model was better suited to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\n\n\nAfter the regression task, we focused on a binary classification problem: predicting whether a bike path is a loop (1) or not (0). Given the poor R² from the linear regression, we chose to avoid logistic regression and instead used a decision tree for classification. We tuned the max_depth hyperparameter and found that a value of 7 yielded the best performance.\n\nOptimal hyperparameter: max_depth = 7\nAccuracy: 78%\nConfusion Matrix:\n\nNegative recall: 100%\nNegative precision: 75%\nPositive recall: 33%\nPositive precision: 100%\n\n\nThe model performed well in terms of accuracy, but the confusion matrix revealed that it frequently predicted the non-loop class (0), likely due to class imbalance in the dataset. This bias resulted in a low positive recall.\n\n\n\nFinally, we aimed to predict the ‘state1’ variable, which represents multiple categories. We evaluated the model by testing various max_depth values to find the optimal setting. We selected max_depth = 2 based on its performance.\n\nOptimal hyperparameter: max_depth = 2\nTest Accuracy: 44%\n\nAlthough the model outperformed random guessing, with an accuracy of 44%, it was not highly predictive. The confusion matrix indicated that the model tended to predict the most prevalent class correctly, but struggled with the other categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression tree emerged as the best-performing model, with a testing RMSE of 0.048, which indicates a good fit. However, further testing with additional data would be important for validating its robustness.\nThe binary classification tree performed well overall, with 78% accuracy, but the confusion matrix highlighted issues with class imbalance. The model heavily favored predicting non-loop paths, which reduced its utility in predicting the loop class.\nThe multiclass classification model achieved an accuracy of 44%, which is marginally better than guessing randomly. It often predicted the most common class, but failed to predict the other categories accurately. More data and improved feature engineering would likely enhance the performance of this model.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong all models tested, the regression tree offered the best performance with the lowest RMSE. The binary classification tree showed promising accuracy but suffered from class imbalance issues. The multiclass model’s performance was the weakest, highlighting the need for better predictive features or more data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression tree is the most reliable model for this dataset, as it can better capture non-linear relationships. For classification tasks, particularly binary classification, addressing class imbalance and tuning the model further is crucial.

    "text": "Cleaning the raw trail data was a critical step in extracting meaningful insights. The descriptions of each bike trail contained a wealth of information, making data cleaning essential for conducting deeper exploratory analysis and enabling robust machine learning applications. It’s important to note that data cleaning is a dynamic and iterative process. As this project evolves, additional cleaning may be required. Below is a summary of the transformations applied to produce the cleaned dataset.\n\n\n\n\nUnpaved: Binary variable (1 = unpaved road, 0 = paved road).\nFlat: Binary variable (1 = flat road, 0 = not flat).\nWorkout: Binary variable (1 = trail designed for workouts, 0 = not designed for workouts).\nPark: Binary variable (1 = trail located in a park, 0 = not located in a park).\nRiver: Binary variable (1 = trail runs along a river, 0 = does not run along a river).\nLoop: Binary variable (1 = trail forms a loop, 0 = does not form a loop).\nSentiment: Float variable measuring the sentiment score of the trail description.\nState1: The state where the trail begins.\nState2: The state where the trail ends.\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset initially had no missing values—every cell contained data. To confirm, we used the is.na().sum() function in Python to verify the absence of null or missing values. When text-scraping trail descriptions to generate binary variables (e.g., identifying if the word “workout” was present), missing words were assumed to indicate the absence of that characteristic, and the corresponding cell was assigned a value of 0.\n\n\n\nOutliers were not a significant concern. For instance, while the C&O Towpath trail spans 184 miles—considerably longer than most other trails—removing such outliers was unnecessary. Given the limited number of bike trails in the DMV area, retaining all observations was crucial for maintaining data integrity and size.\n\n\n\nThe raw dataset contained two data types: object (trail names and descriptions) and int64 (ratings and mileage). After cleaning, the dataset included object, int64, and float64 types:\n\nObject: name, state1, state2.\nFloat64: sentiment.\nInt64: All other features.\n\nDescriptions were transformed to lowercase for consistency and ease of keyword matching. The most significant transformation involved converting descriptions into multiple binary (one-hot-encoded) features based on meaningful keywords, as described in the “New Variables” section. State information was also extracted using lists of specific locations within Virginia, Maryland, DC, and Pennsylvania, allowing us to assign values to state1 and state2. This process enabled the extraction of numerical data from text, enriching the dataset for subsequent machine learning analyses.\n\n\n\nGiven the significant right skew in the mileage distribution, normalization was applied. We used z-score normalization to scale this variable, ensuring it would not disproportionately influence machine learning models. Both normalized and unnormalized mileage distributions are provided in the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\nSubsetting is unnecessary due to the already small size of the dataset."

Below, we outline the methodology and results for each type of test:\n\nKolmogorov-Smirnov Test\nTo assess the normality of the numerical variables (mileage and sentiment), we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results indicated that both variables appear to be normally distributed:\n\nSentiment: p-value ≈ 0.198\nMileage: p-value ≈ 0.091\n\nSince the p-values are greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that both variables are likely normally distributed.\n\n\nt-Tests (Continuous vs. Binary Variables)\nWe performed t-tests to compare the means of numerical variables (sentiment and mileage) across each binary variable in the dataset. For every combination:\n\nThe p-values were greater than 0.05.\nThis indicates that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant differences in means between the numerical variables from the lens of the the binary features.\n\n\n\nChi-Squared Tests (Categorical Features)\nWe used chi-squared tests to examine the independence between all pairs of categorical variables (traffic, terrain, scenery, state1, and state2). The results revealed statistically significant associations for the following pairs:\n\nTraffic vs. Terrain: p-value ≈ 0.039\nTerrain vs. State1: p-value ≈ 0.033\nState1 vs. State2: p-value ≈ 5.61e-11\n\nFor these pairs, we reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05, concluding that these categorical variables are not independent. All other pairs yielded p-values greater than 0.05, indicating no evidence of dependence.\n\n\nANOVA Tests (Continuous vs. Categorical Variables)\nWe conducted ANOVA tests to compare the means of continuous variables (sentiment and mileage) across the levels of categorical variables. Notable results include:\n\nSentiment across Terrain Levels: p-value ≈ 0.028\n\nThis suggests a significant difference in sentiment means across terrain categories, leading us to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nSentiment across Traffic Levels: p-value ≈ 0.059\n\nAlthough this result is close, it does not meet the 0.05 significance threshold.\n\n\nFor all other tests, the p-values were greater than 0.05, indicating no significant differences in means across the levels of the binary or categorical variables.\n\n\nStatistical Summary\n\nNormality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov): Both sentiment and mileage are likely normally distributed.\nt-Tests: No significant differences in means between numerical and binary variables.\nChi-Squared Tests: Significant associations observed for traffic vs. terrain, terrain vs. state1, and state1 vs. state2.\nANOVA: Significant differences in sentiment across terrain levels; no other significant results.\n\nThese findings provide insights into the relationships within the dataset and guide further analysis."

    "text": "Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction\nIn this section we explore the effectiveness of dimensionality reducing techniques.\n\nPCA\nFirst we prepared the data by removing non-numeric columns, leaving only numerical features in numeric_df. The remaining data is then standardized with StandardScaler to ensure all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This standardization is necessary because PCA can be sensitive to the scale of the data. PCA is applied to the scaled data without specifying the number of components, resulting in all possible components being computed. The pca.fit_transform method transforms the data into the new principal component space. The explained_variance_ratio_ attribute of the PCA object provides the proportion of variance explained by each component. Then we visualize the cumulative sum of this explained variance against the number of PCA components to identify a “cutoff” point. The line is pretty constant but we believe 90% is a sufficient portion, so we conclude that 7 principal components is sufficient.\n\n# Standardize the data (often helps with clustering)\nnumeric_df = df.drop(columns=['name','state1','state2'])\nscaled_df = StandardScaler().fit_transform(numeric_df)\n\n# Apply PCA\npca = PCA()\n# apply pca to scaled data\npca_result = pca.fit_transform(scaled_df)\n\n# plot explained variance\nexplained_variance_ratio = pca.explained_variance_ratio_\n# plot number of components against cumulative explained variance\nplt.plot(range(1, len(explained_variance_ratio) + 1), explained_variance_ratio.cumsum(), marker='o')\n# label the plot\nplt.title('Cumulative Explained Variance by PCA Components')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Components')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Explained Variance')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, since we can’t visualize what something is looks like in 7-dimensions, we will apply the first 2 components to visualize the data in two dimensions. We plot this 2D visualization, where The x-axis and y-axis correspond to the first and second principal components. Points are color-coded based on the sentiment column from the original dataset, allowing for the identification of patterns or clusters related to sentiment. This 2D visualization provides an intuitive way to observe structure and relationships in the data, such as clustering tendencies or separations between different sentiment values.\nThe only trend that appears in sentiment is that lower sentiments appear lower across principal component 2 and increase with it. This could mean a couple of things:\n\nThe lack of distinct clusters might indicate that the variables in the dataset do not exhibit strong groupings or separations related to the target variable\nPCA is a linear dimensionality reduction method, meaning it captures only linear relationships in the data. If the relationships between variables and sentiment are non-linear, PCA might not reveal meaningful clusters.\nIf the explained variance ratio of the first two components is relatively low, it suggests that the 2D representation does not capture much of the total variance in the data.\n\nIn our case the 3rd explanation makes the most sense as we saw in the previous graph how the variance is not explained very well until about 6 or 7 components. Let’s check out the rank varibles.\n\n# Reduce dimensions to 2D\npca_2d = PCA(n_components=2)\n# fit PCA to scaled data\npca_2d_result = pca_2d.fit_transform(scaled_df)\n\n# plot resulting 2 d representation of data \nplt.scatter(pca_2d_result[:, 0], pca_2d_result[:, 1], c=df['sentiment'], cmap='viridis')\n# label the plot\nplt.title('PCA: 2D Visualization')\nplt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')\nplt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')\nplt.colorbar(label='Sentiment Score')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow we graph the principal components for all the variables that were ranked for the bike routes. We begin to see some clusters or trends in these plots.\n\n# define rank vars\nrank_vars = ['terrain','traffic', 'scenery']\n# make subplots to plot them next to eachother\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))\n# loop through the axes and plot each\nfor i in range(len(axes)):\n    im = axes[i].scatter(pca_2d_result[:, 0], pca_2d_result[:, 1], c=df[rank_vars[i]], cmap='viridis')\n    # add colorbar to each as they are all different\n    fig.colorbar(im, label=f'{rank_vars[i].capitalize()} Score', ax=axes[i])\n# label the plots\nfig.suptitle('PCA: 2D Visualization')\nfig.supxlabel('Principal Component 1')\nfig.supylabel('Principal Component 2')    \nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTSNE\nThis code applies t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, to visualize the dataset in two dimensions. Unlike PCA, which is linear, t-SNE is designed to preserve local structure in the data, making it particularly effective for revealing patterns such as clusters in datasets with complex relationships.\nSince we have a relatively small dataset (only 43 observations), we will search across a smaller range of perplexity values since the value controls how many neighbors are used for each point. Here we iterate over the perplexity values of 5 to 30, computing the KL Divergence at each perplexity, and plot them against each other. Perplexities that yield lower KL divergence indicate that the t-SNE embedding is better at maintaining the data’s structure. This helps determine an appropriate perplexity value for the dataset without relying solely on trial-and-error. We don’t see any substantial improvements after 20, and adding more might distort as we near the total number of observations.\n\n# initialize list to hold kl div vals and which perplexities we want to test\nkl_vals = []\nperps = range(5,30)\n# iterate over the perplexities\nfor i in perps:\n    # fit tsne with using current perplexity\n    tsne = TSNE(perplexity=i, random_state=24).fit(scaled_df)\n    # append kl divergence\n    kl_vals.append(tsne.kl_divergence_)\n# plot kl divergence against perplexity\nplt.plot(perps, kl_vals, marker='o')\nplt.title('KL Divergence by TSNE Perplexity')\nplt.xlabel('Perplexity')\nplt.ylabel('KL Divergence')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process begins by initializing t-SNE with two dimensions (n_components=2) to reduce the data into a 2D space suitable for visualization. The perplexity parameter, set to 20, controls the balance between local and global structure in the embedding, while a fixed random_state ensures reproducibility of the results. The algorithm transforms the scaled features into a new coordinate system, capturing the intricate non-linear relationships that may not be evident in PCA’s linear projections. The 2D results are plotted as a scatter plot, where each point corresponds to a data instance. The points are color-coded by the sentiment column to visually explore whether distinct groupings or gradients align with the sentiment values. We don’t see any distinctive clustering in the data across the sentiment score.\n\n# Apply t-SNE\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=20, random_state=24)\ntsne_result = tsne.fit_transform(scaled_df)\n# Visualize t-SNE results\nplt.scatter(tsne_result[:, 0], tsne_result[:, 1], c=df['sentiment'], cmap='viridis', alpha=0.8)\nplt.title('t-SNE: 2D Visualization')\nplt.xlabel('t-SNE Dimension 1')\nplt.ylabel('t-SNE Dimension 2')\nplt.colorbar(label='Sentiment Score')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to above with PCA. We plot the t-SNE again using the ranked variables to color the points. There still doesn’t seem to be any obvious clustering, but there is some patterns seen.\n\n# make subplots to plot them next to eachother\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))\n# loop through the axes and plot each\nfor i in range(len(axes)):\n    im = axes[i].scatter(tsne_result[:, 0], tsne_result[:, 1], c=df[rank_vars[i]], cmap='viridis')\n    # add colorbar to each as they are all different\n    fig.colorbar(im, label=f'{rank_vars[i].capitalize()} Score', ax=axes[i])\n# label the plots\nfig.suptitle('t-SNE: 2D Visualization')\nfig.supxlabel('t-SNE Dimension 1')\nfig.supylabel('t-SNE Dimension 2')    \nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation\nBoth PCA and t-SNE were applied to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality for visualization, but neither method produced distinct, well-separated clusters. However, some patterns were observed, suggesting that the data does contain structure, although not strong enough for clear cluster separation in a 2D representation. This outcome highlights the need to carefully evaluate the strengths and limitations of each method when applied to high-dimensional data.\nAs a linear technique, PCA captures the directions of maximum variance in the data and projects it onto fewer dimensions. It excels at preserving global structure, making it effective for understanding overarching patterns or trends. However, it’s reliance on linear projections means it may not reveal subtle, non-linear relationships. The cumulative explained variance plot provided insight into how much of the data’s variability is retained by the reduced components.\nIn contrast, t-SNE is designed to handle non-linear structures by preserving local similarities between data points. Its visualization often reveals small-scale patterns, such as clusters of similar instances, that might be missed by PCA. In this case, t-SNE revealed patterns that were not fully captured by PCA, but the lack of strong, distinct groupings suggests that either the data does not have well-defined clusters.\nThe following are some scenearios in which one method might be better than the other: - PCA is ideal when the primary goal is dimensionality reduction for interpretability, feature analysis, or global trend visualization. It is computationally efficient and works well with linearly separable data. - t-SNE is better suited for uncovering non-linear patterns and exploring local relationships, especially when clustering or separation is of interest in highly complex datasets. However, it is less effective for preserving global data structure and requires careful parameter tuning."

    "text": "Part 2: Clustering Methods\nNext we will apply clustering techniques to the data to uncover any groupings that exist.\n\nK-Means\nK-Means is a widely-used clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into a pre-defined number of clusters. It operates by initializing cluster centroids, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and iteratively updating the centroids based on the mean positions of points within each cluster. This process continues until the assignments stabilize, minimizing the within-cluster variance.\nA key aspect of K-Means is determining the optimal number of clusters, often guided by methods such as the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score Analysis. The Elbow Method involves plotting the inertia, or the sum of squared distances of samples to their cluster, against the number of clusters and looking for a point where adding more clusters yields diminishing improvements. Silhouette score evaluates cluster quality by measuring how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to others. It compares the average distance between a data point and other points in its cluster to the average distance to points in other clusters. While K-Means is computationally efficient and effective for well-separated clusters, it assumes spherical cluster shapes and may perform poorly with non-spherical distributions or data with significant outliers.\nBelow, we perform both methods to select an optimal number of clusters. First, we loop over the different values for the number of clusters and store their inertia and silhouette scores. We then plot these against the number of clusters to find a point that is diminishing returns for the elbow method, or the best score for silhouette score. We see somewhat of a drop-off at 8 or 9 for the elbow silhouette score so we cross check with the elbow method. While the inertia continues to decrease, it displays diminishing returns at this point.\n\n# initialize the k vals to test, and lists to store scores\nk_vals = range(2,20)\nsil_scores = []\ninertias = []\n# iterate over k vals\nfor k in k_vals:\n    # fit the model to our data using current k\n    kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=24).fit(scaled_df)\n    # append inertia to list\n    inertias.append(kmeans_model.inertia_)\n    # Extract score and append to list. Appene current k\n    score = silhouette_score(scaled_df, kmeans_model.labels_)\n    sil_scores.append(score)\n\n# plot elbow method\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(k_vals, inertias, \"-o\")\nplt.title(\"Optimal clusters using Elbow Method\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Intertias\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Num Clusters\")\nplt.show()\n# plot silouette score \nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(k_vals, sil_scores, '-o')\nplt.title(\"Optimal clusters using Silhouete Score\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Silhouette Score\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Num Clusters\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the K-Means algorithm is applied with 8 clusters and each data point is assigned to one of these clusters, the resulting labels added to the DataFrame under the column kmeans_cluster. For visualization, the code uses the t-SNE result to map the high-dimensional data into two dimensions, where points are plotted and color-coded by their assigned K-Means cluster. The scatter plot illustrates how the clusters identified by K-Means are distributed in the 2 dimensional space.\nThe graph reveals reasonably well-defined clusters, indicating that the K-Means algorithm has effectively grouped similar data points. However, the clusters are unbalanced, with some containing very few points while others are relatively large. This imbalance could be explained by inherent characteristics of the dataset, such as a naturally skewed distribution of data or an uneven density of points across the feature space. The imbalance in cluster sizes highlights a potential limitation of K-Means in this context. While the algorithm minimizes variance within clusters, it assumes clusters of similar sizes and may assign small groups to their own clusters if their variance significantly differs from larger groups.\n\n# Optimal Clusters\noptimal_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=8, random_state=24)\ndf['kmeans_cluster'] = optimal_kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_df)\n\n# plot points in tsne space, colored on kmeans cluster\nplt.scatter(tsne_result[:, 0], tsne_result[:, 1], c=df['kmeans_cluster'])\nplt.title('t-SNE Clusters with K-Means')\nplt.xlabel('t-SNE Dimension 1')\nplt.ylabel('t-SNE Dimension 2')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBSCAN\nDBSCAN, which stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, is a non-parametric clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on data density. It groups points that are densely packed together while marking points in low-density regions as noise. The most important hyper-parameters for DBSCAN are eps (maximum distance for points to be considered neighbors) and min_samples (minimum number of points required to form a dense region).\nUnlike K-Means, DBSCAN does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance, making it particularly useful for datasets with irregular cluster shapes or varying densities. However, parameter selection is crucial. Techniques like examining the k-distance plot can help identify an appropriate eps value by finding a knee point, where the distance increases sharply. DBSCAN is robust to noise and handles non-spherical clusters well, but it may struggle with high-dimensional data where density estimation becomes challenging or when eps is not appropriately tuned for the dataset’s scale.\nThe code below steps through identifying the optimal parameters for DBSCAN. This 2D grid search covers ranges for both eps and min_sample calculates the silhouette score at every combination of the two parameters, updating the best score and parameter values if better than what has been seen before. Since we are dealing with data that is fairly spread out in the vector space, we look at higher values of eps than is traditionally used. Also, note that in order to calculate silhouette score, the number of clusters needs to be at least 2 and less than the number of observations in the data. After iterating through all possible combinations, the code prints the best silhouette score, along with the corresponding eps and min_samples values.\nThis approach serves to automate the parameter tuning process for DBSCAN, which can be challenging since the algorithm’s performance is highly sensitive to eps and min_samples. By evaluating all combinations within the specified ranges and using the silhouette score as a measure of quality, this method ensures that the best-performing parameters are selected.\n\n# intialize values\nbest_eps = None\nbest_min_sample = None\nbest_score = -1\n# iterate through values for both eps values and min_sample\nfor eps in np.arange(.1,4,.1):\n    for min_sample in range(1,10):\n        # make dbscan model with current parameters\n        dbscan_model = DBSCAN(eps=eps, min_samples=min_sample).fit(scaled_df)\n        # if labels fit within requirements, calculate silhouette score\n        if 1 &lt; len(set(dbscan_model.labels_)) &lt; len(scaled_df):\n            score = silhouette_score(scaled_df, dbscan_model.labels_)\n            # if current score is better than our best, reset parameters\n            if score &gt; best_score:\n                best_score = score\n                best_eps, best_min_sample = eps, min_sample\n\n# Ouput results\nprint(\"Best Score:\", best_score, \"\\nBest Epsilon:\", best_eps, \"\\nBest min sample: \", best_min_sample)\n\nBest Score: 0.3176437786872938 \nBest Epsilon: 3.4000000000000004 \nBest min sample:  3\n\n\nHere the DBSCAN algorithm is applied with the optimal parameters to our dataset and the predicted clusters are added to the data frame. Next, the scatter plot maps the cluster assignments onto the 2D t-SNE space of the data. Each point is color-coded according to its dbscan_cluster label, with a color bar to distinguish different clusters.\nSeveral points are labeled as -1, representing noise. This indicates that these points were in low-density areas or isolated regions of the dataset, which DBSCAN appropriately excludes from clusters. While this can reflect meaningful patterns, such as outliers or transitional areas between clusters, it may also suggest that some relevant data points are being excluded as in our case of attempting to cluster bike routes. We also notice that the clusters uneven in size, with one containing all but three of the data points. This imbalance often occurs with DBSCAN, as the algorithm naturally groups points into clusters based on density rather than trying to create clusters of equal size. Overall, the clusters aren’t very informative, highlighting the challenges of interpreting imbalanced clusters and noise in the context of the dataset.\n\n# fit dbscan with optimal params and add column to df\ndbscan = DBSCAN(eps=best_eps, min_samples=best_min_sample)\ndf['dbscan_cluster'] = dbscan.fit_predict(scaled_df)\n# plot the clusters\nplt.scatter(tsne_result[:, 0], tsne_result[:, 1], c=df['dbscan_cluster'], label=df['dbscan_cluster'])\nplt.title('t-SNE Clusters with DBSCAN')\nplt.xlabel('t-SNE Dimension 1')\nplt.ylabel('t-SNE Dimension 2')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical Clustering\nHierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure to represent the relationships between data points. It comes in two forms: agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down). Agglomerative clustering, the more common approach, starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges the closest clusters iteratively until a single cluster is formed. This is the approach we will use in our analysis.\nThere are several important hyper-parameters with agglomerative clustering, such as, choice of linkage criteria, choice of distance metric, and number of clusters. However, in our analysis we will just focus on n_clusters as the other two are more complex and reach beyond the scope of our analysis. Hierarchical clustering is effective for small to medium-sized datasets where relationships between points are more intuitive. However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets and may suffer from sensitivity to noise and outliers.\nThis code below is designed to evaluate the performance of the Agglomerative Clustering algorithm across a range of potential cluster counts using the Silhouette Score. The goal is to identify the optimal number of clusters by analyzing how well-separated the clusters are in terms of their cohesion (internal) and separation (external). We iterate over a range of clusters, knowing we need at least 2 and picking a value lower than our total observations. For each number of clusters, we create an instance of the AgglomerativeClustering model with the current number of clusters, fit the model to the scaled dataset, and calculate the silhouette score. Then plot these scores against the number of clusters. We see a stark drop after 3 clusters and then a slow build to a local maximum at 18. While 3 clusters produces a better result, the behavior around the point is less predictable.\n\n# initialize to hold info\nn_vals  = range(2,30)\nsil_scores = []\n# loop through n values, need at least 2 clusters for silhouette\nfor n in n_vals:\n    # fit the model to our data using current n\n    cluster_model = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=n).fit(scaled_df)\n    # get score and add to list\n    score = silhouette_score(scaled_df, cluster_model.labels_)\n    sil_scores.append(score)\n    \n# plot the scores against clusts\nplt.plot(n_vals, sil_scores, '-o')\nplt.title(\"Optimal clusters using Silhouete Score\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Silhouette Score\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Num Clusters\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs explained above, the behavior near 3 clusters is less predictable, so here we apply the clustering using the other maximum of 18 clusters. Similar as what was done with K-Means and DBSCAN, we plot the data in the 2D t-SNE space color based on the predicted cluster assignments.\nThe clusters appear reasonably well-separated, with distinct groups of points that reflect the underlying structure of the data. This suggests that Agglomerative Clustering has identified meaningful patterns or groupings within the dataset. However, the presence of a relatively large number of clusters, could indicate that the clustering algorithm has over-partitioned the data. The high number of clusters could also be indicative of the algorithm’s sensitivity to the distance metric and the scale of the data. As seen in the second plot, where we try 3 clusters, the outcome is even less informative.\n\n# fit model using 2 clusters\nagg_cluster = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=18)\n# add predictions back to df\ndf['agg_cluster'] = agg_cluster.fit_predict(scaled_df)\n\n# plot points colored on agglomerative cluster\nplt.scatter(tsne_result[:, 0], tsne_result[:, 1], c=df['agg_cluster'])\nplt.title('t-SNE Clusters with Hierarchical Clustering')\nplt.xlabel('t-SNE Dimension 1')\nplt.ylabel('t-SNE Dimension 2')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n\n# plot again using only 2 clusters\ncluster3 = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=3).fit_predict(scaled_df)\nplt.scatter(tsne_result[:, 0], tsne_result[:, 1], c=cluster3)\nplt.title('t-SNE Clusters with Hierarchical Clustering')\nplt.xlabel('t-SNE Dimension 1')\nplt.ylabel('t-SNE Dimension 2')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nIn this analysis, three clustering algorithms—K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering—were applied to the dataset of bike routes in Washington, DC, with the goal of identifying natural groupings of the routes based on their features, such as distance, ratings, descriptions, and sentiment\nK-Means clustering provided a reasonable grouping of bike routes into 10 clusters, as determined by evaluating different cluster counts and selecting the optimal number based on silhouette scores. The resulting clusters appeared somewhat balanced in terms of size, though there were a few smaller clusters containing fewer routes. The clusters formed by K-Means generally aligned with routes that shared common features, such as similar distances or ratings.\nDBSCAN was effective at identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes. The algorithm’s ability to classify some data points as noise (assigned the label -1) highlighted routes that did not fit well into any of the primary clusters. While DBSCAN’s ability to identify noise is beneficial for excluding irrelevant data, it resulted in an uneven distribution of clusters. Many of the clusters formed were relatively small, and several routes were classified as noise. This imbalance points to the algorithm’s sensitivity to the density of points, and it suggests that DBSCAN may be more suited for datasets that aren’t as empty in the vector space as ours.\nAgglomerative Clustering with 17 clusters produced the most granular results, splitting the bike routes into small and imbalanced clusters. This high number of clusters indicated that the algorithm over-partitioned the data, potentially identifying small, subtle groupings that might not have significant practical meaning. The large number of clusters posed a challenge for interpreting the results, as the small clusters could represent noise or slight variations in the routes, which may not be as valuable for decision-making."

The results indicated that both variables appear to be normally distributed:\n\nSentiment: p-value ≈ 0.198\nMileage: p-value ≈ 0.091\n\nSince the p-values are greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that both variables are likely normally distributed.\n\n\nt-Tests (Continuous vs. Binary Variables)\nWe performed t-tests to compare the means of numerical variables (sentiment and mileage) across each binary variable in the dataset. For every combination:\n\nThe p-values were greater than 0.05.\nThis indicates that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant differences in means between the numerical variables from the lens of the the binary features.\n\n\n\nChi-Squared Tests (Categorical Features)\nWe used chi-squared tests to examine the independence between all pairs of categorical variables (traffic, terrain, scenery, state1, and state2). The results revealed statistically significant associations for the following pairs:\n\nTraffic vs. Terrain: p-value ≈ 0.039\nTerrain vs. State1: p-value ≈ 0.033\nState1 vs. State2: p-value ≈ 5.61e-11\n\nFor these pairs, we reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05, concluding that these categorical variables are not independent.

Notable results include:\n\nSentiment across Terrain Levels: p-value ≈ 0.028\n\nThis suggests a significant difference in sentiment means across terrain categories, leading us to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nSentiment across Traffic Levels: p-value ≈ 0.059\n\nAlthough this result is close, it does not meet the 0.05 significance threshold.\n\n\nFor all other tests, the p-values were greater than 0.05, indicating no significant differences in means across the levels of the binary or categorical variables.\n\n\nStatistical Summary\n\nNormality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov): Both sentiment and mileage are likely normally distributed.\nt-Tests: No significant differences in means between numerical and binary variables.\nChi-Squared Tests: Significant associations observed for traffic vs. terrain, terrain vs. state1, and state1 vs. state2.\nANOVA: Significant differences in sentiment across terrain levels; no other significant results.\n\nThese findings provide insights into the relationships within the dataset and guide further analysis."

    "text": "Introduction and Motivation\nThe primary objective of this analysis is to explore and identify meaningful groupings within a dataset of bike routes in Washington, DC, based on features like distance, ratings, sentiment, and route descriptions. By applying clustering techniques, we aim to uncover hidden patterns that can offer insights into the structure of bike routes across the city. To aid in visualizing these patterns, we also conduct dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE. These methods help reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional data, allowing for clearer visualization and interpretation of the clustering results. The analysis involves testing three clustering algorithms—K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering—and comparing their performance in terms of cluster quality and relevance to the underlying features of the routes. Ultimately, the goal is to identify clusters that can inform urban planning and biking route optimization in a practical context.\n\n\nOverview of Methods\nThis analysis employs three clustering algorithms to identify groups within the bike routes dataset, along with dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize the results effectively:\n\nPCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. PCA compresses the features into principal components, capturing the most important variance in the dataset, while t-SNE further reduces the data to two dimensions, making it easier to visualize the clusters.\nK-Means Clustering: K-Means is a partitioning-based algorithm that assigns data points into a predefined number of clusters by iterating between assigning points to the nearest centroid and updating the centroids based on these assignments. The number of clusters (n_clusters) is determined by evaluating the silhouette score, a metric that measures how well-separated the clusters are.\nDBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their proximity to each other and the density of their surroundings. Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance. It relies on two hyperparameters: eps (the maximum distance between two points to be considered neighbors) and min_samples (the minimum number of points required to form a cluster). DBSCAN also identifies noise points, which are labeled as -1.\nAgglomerative Clustering: Agglomerative Clustering is a hierarchical method that builds clusters by iteratively merging the closest pairs of clusters. The number of clusters (n_clusters) is specified as a hyperparameter, and the algorithm outputs cluster labels for each data point. Agglomerative Clustering produces a hierarchical tree (dendrogram) that shows how clusters are merged, which can help understand the relationships between different groupings."

    "text": "Introduction\nGoing to a new city can be overwhelming, especially when considering all of the new traditions, attractions, and outdoor activities that come with it. For avid biking fans, this stress is further amplified when trying to find new bike paths to explore. Which bike paths offer the best scenery around the city? Which paths are best for getting to work, going to the grocery store, or going somewhere else important? All of these are natural questions that come to mind when thinking about the biking scene of a new city. Even for those not passionate about biking, companies like Lime, Capital Bikeshare, and others provide accessible eBikes for those looking to get off their feet. Biking, both as a hobby and as a simple mode of transportation, is an essential part of a city’s culture. Not only that, it helps lower carbon emissions, aiding in the environmental footprint a city has. Undoubtedly, biking is an essential activity in the lives of many, especially those living in Washington, DC. It can be a daunting task to look at all bike trails in the area to find ones that best fit your goals. This study attempts to rectify that concern by clustering bike paths based on their inherent qualities. Specifically, we focus on three qualities to cluster the bike paths effectively - difficulty of terrain, the amount of traffic the bike path sees, and the scenery of the bike path. With these characteristics, we hope to group similar bike paths together, allowing the public to see which paths are best for their needs."
