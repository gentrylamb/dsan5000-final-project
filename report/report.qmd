## Introduction

Going to a new city can be overwhelming, especially when considering all of the new traditions, attractions, and outdoor activities that come with it. For avid biking fans, this stress is further amplified when trying to find new bike paths to explore. Which bike paths offer the best scenery around the city? Which paths are best for getting to work, going to the grocery store, or going somewhere else important? All of these are natural questions that come to mind when thinking about the biking scene of a new city. Even for those not passionate about biking, companies like Lime, Capital Bikeshare, and others provide accessible eBikes for those looking to get off their feet. Biking, both as a hobby and as a simple mode of transportation, is an essential part of a city's culture. Not only that, it helps lower carbon emissions, aiding in the environmental footprint a city has. Undoubtedly, biking is an essential activity in the lives of many, especially those living in Washington, DC. It can be a daunting task to look at all bike trails in the area to find ones that best fit your goals. This study attempts to rectify that concern by clustering bike paths based on their inherent qualities. Specifically, we focus on three qualities to cluster the bike paths effectively - difficulty of terrain, the amount of traffic the bike path sees, and the scenery of the bike path. With these characteristics, we hope to group similar bike paths together, allowing the public to see which paths are best for their needs.

## Objective 

The primary goal of this research is to analyze and categorize the bike trails in Washington, DC, to provide valuable insights that help cyclists make informed decisions about their routes. By examining key characteristics of the trails, such as distance, terrain difficulty, traffic conditions, and scenic value, we aim to create a comprehensive understanding of the biking infrastructure in the city. The study specifically focuses on the objectives of trail clustering and predicting route attributes. 

By employing different clustering algorithms, we attempt to group bike trails with similar characteristics such as distance, terrain, traffic and more. This will allow cyclists to easily identify trails that best match their preferences, whether they seek leisurely recreation or a physically demanding workout. Beyond just cyclists, grouping data can be used by city planners in addressing gaps in trail diversity when expanding trails to new areas. For example, if there are few trails catering to beginners with flat terrain and low traffic, planners can prioritize adding such routes to balance the network and make cycling more accessible.

*Predicting route attributes - talk about supervised learning and trying to make a model that can predict things about the routes based on other features*

## Key Findings

Clustering is possible but not the most interpretable ... 



## Methodology Overview

### Data

To gain a comprehensive understanding of bike trails in Washington, DC, we gathered data from [bikewashington.org](http://bikewashington.org/routes/index.htm), which includes information on trail names, descriptions, distances, and ratings for terrain, traffic, and scenery. We used advanced data analysis techniques to process this information, including statistical tests to compare trail characteristics and clustering methods to group similar trails. Additionally, we explored sentiment analysis of trail descriptions to gauge the general tone and rider experience.
